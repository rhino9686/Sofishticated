This was our final project for EECS 473. We made a monitoring system that could connect to fish tanks.

## Installation:
Be advised that this software was designed for a custom PCB designed and constructed from scratch, but can be adapted to any Arduino or Atmel system with a bit of hacking.

## The Good stuff
All the C/C++ code that we run on the baord is in LilFishTanks/LilFishTanks/lil_fish_tanks_arduino/

All the Phone App code is in FishTank_app/FishTank/FishTank/
